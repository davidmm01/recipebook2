ingredients:
  - 60ml mirin
  - 1½ Tbsp sake

  - 60ml soy sauce
instructions:
  - In a small saucepan, add the mirin, sake and sugar. Turn on the heat to medium and whisk all the ingredients together.
  - Add soy sauce and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and continue simmering for 10 minutes. Toward the end of cooking, you will see more bubbles.
  - Turn off the heat and let it cool. The sauce will thicken as it cools.
notes:
  - A great way to dress up frozen unagi. Leftovers can be used to dress fried rice for a sweeter taste.
