cuisine: chinese
ingredients:
  # sauce
  - 100ml soy sauce
  - 60g honey
  - 70g tbsp Oyster sauce (sub Hoisin)
  - 3 tbsp Chinese cooking wine , Mirin or dry sherry (Note 2)
  - 2 tbsp water
  - 1 tsp coarsely crushed black pepper (or 1/2 tsp normal ground black pepper)
  # Stir Fry
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 onion, sliced
  - 500g thinly sliced beef steak
  - 1 carrot, julienned
  - 1 head broccoli, cut to small floretts
  - 450g tofu, cut into cubes
instructions:
  - Mix the Sauce ingredients in a bowl.
  - Steam the broccoli and carrot for a couple mins in the microwave
  - Heat some oil in a wok or large heavy based skillet over high heat until it is smoking.
  - Add the onion and garlic and cook for 1 minute or until the onion becomes translucent. Keep it moving so the garlic doesn't burn.
  - Add the beef and stir fry for 1 minute until just cooked to your liking, then remove into bowl.
  - Turn the heat down to medium high, pour in Sauce - it will start simmering very quickly! Let it cook for 1 minute or so until it becomes syrupy - the bubbles will be larger and caramel colour.
  - Add the tofu in and let it warm
  - Add the vegetables, beef and onion back into the wok, along with any juices pooled on the plate. Toss in the sauce until just warmed through - 1 minute at most. Don't overcook the beef - that would be tragic!
  - Serve with rice
notes:
  - would work with pork or chicken too
