ingredients:
  - ⅓ cup plain bread crumbs
  - ½ cup milk
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1 onion, diced
  - 500g ground beef
  - 500g ground pork
  - 2 eggs
  - 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
  - ¼ bunch fresh parsley, chopped
  - 3 cloves garlic, crushed
  - 2 teaspoons salt
  - 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
  - 1 teaspoon dried Italian herb seasoning
  - ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
instructions:
  - Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.
  - Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.
  - Preheat the oven to 220 degrees C.
  - Form mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
  - Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.
notes:
  - Great to serve with a red sauce pasta, or as is.
