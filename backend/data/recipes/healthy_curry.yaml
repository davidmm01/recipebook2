  - Start the base gravy, by first adding 2tbsp oil and onions to a large pot. Let cook down until nice and soft, atleast 15min.
  - Add ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, just a minute or so.
  - Add the carrot and capsicum and cook down a bit, then add the tomato and cook it all down. Add some water if any risk of burning at any stage.
  - Once it's cooked down, transfer to a blender and blend. Set aside for later.
  - Now back in the same (now empty) pot, add another 2 tbsp of oil. Once hot, add the whole spices and cook for a minute.
  - Add the chicken and brown it all around in the fragrant oil.
  - Once the chicken is sealed on the outside, add in the gravy sauce and the powder additions.
  - Add the veg and cook it and its done.
