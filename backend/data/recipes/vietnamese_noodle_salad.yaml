  - 15 ml soy sauce
  - 25 g brown sugar

  # For the nuoc cham sauce:

  - 60 ml fish sauce
  - 38 g sugar
  - 1 red chili, de-seeded and sliced, or substitute 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce or Sriracha

  # To assemble the bowls:
  - 200g dried rice vermicelli noodles
  - 250g bean sprouts
  - 1 large carrot, julienned
  - 1 seedless cucumber, julienned
  - 2 baby cos lettuce, finely julienned
  - 400g cherry tomatoes, halved
  - Mint
  - Corriander
instructions:
  - In a medium bowl, combine the chicken thighs with your marinade ingredients, and set aside at room temperature for 30 mins to 1 hour while you prepare the other salad ingredients.
  - Combine all the nuoc cham ingredients and stir until the sugar has completely dissolved into the sauce. Taste and adjust any of the ingredients if desired.
  - Boil the rice vermicelli noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Set aside in a colander.
  - Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a cast iron skillet, grill pan, or frying pan over medium high heat. Sear the chicken for about 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Set aside on a plate.
  - To assemble the salad, combine the rice noodles with bean sprouts, julienned carrots and cucumber, romaine lettuce, mint, and cilantro. Slice the chicken thighs and add to the salad. Serve with your nuoc cham sauce.
notes:
  - Also excellent without any meat as a side dish
  - Would work great with any meat, but particularly beef
next:
  - We haven't actually tried this with the chicken yet, do that!
