servings: 2
notes:
  - We cooked this with prawns from frozen. The trick was we put the prawns BEFORE the galric and spring onion and let them cook on their own for a bit. Let them release water, drain it, then add more oil and the aromatics.
next:
  - try adding 1 or 2tbsp of tomato sauce for more tomato richness
