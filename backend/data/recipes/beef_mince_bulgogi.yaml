  - To a large mixing bowl, add the ground beef, mushrooms, and marinade. Give it a good mix.
  # COOK BULGOGI
  - In a wok (or pan), heat the oil (2 tbsp) over medium-high heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the white parts of the green onions and onion. Saute for 3 minutes or until they start to go brown.
  - Add the beef mixture and cook for 7 to 8 minutes or until most of the liquid has evaporated. Make sure to break up the beef and keep stirring it.
  - Turn the heat off. Add the chili peppers (if using), green onions, and sesame oil (1/2 tbsp). Give it a final mix.
