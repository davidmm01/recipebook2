ingredients:
  - 670g onions, sliced
  - 2 carrots (6.7 oz, 190 g)
  - 3 Yukon gold potatoes (15 oz, 432 g)
  - 1 tsp ginger (grated)
  - 2 cloves garlic
  - ½ apple (6 oz, 170 g)
  - 1½ lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (see Notes for substitutions)
  - freshly ground black pepper
  # curry sauce
  - 1½ Tbsp neutral oil (for cooking)
  - 4 cups low sodium chicken stock/broth (the curry already salty, can always add more salt later to taste)
  - 1 Tbsp honey
  - 1 Tbsp soy sauce
  - 1 Tbsp ketchup
  - 200g Japanese curry roux (1 packet)
instructions:
  - Heat 1½ Tbsp neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat and add the onion.
  - Sauté the onions, stirring occasionally, until they become translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Don't stir them too often because they won't develop a golden color. Cooked onions add amazing flavor, so don't skip this step. If you have extra time, definitely sauté the onions an additional 5 minutes to add more color and flavor.
  - Add the minced garlic (I pass it through a garlic press for a finer texture) and grated ginger and mix well together.
  - Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it's no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.
  - Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth.
  - Add the grated apple, 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and 1 Tbsp ketchup (or any condiment you choose to add). Please read my blog post for details.
  - Add the carrots and Yukon gold potatoes (if you're using russet potatoes, add them later in the last 15-20 minutes of cooking). The broth should barely cover the ingredients. Don't worry; we don't want too much liquid here, and additional liquid will be released from the meat and vegetables.
  - Simmer, covered*, on medium-low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. *Simmer uncovered if the ingredients are completely submerged in the broth.
  - Once boiling, use a fine-mesh strainer to skim the scum and foam from the surface of the broth.
  - Continue to cook covered until a wooden skewer goes through the carrots and potatoes.
  - To Add the Curry Roux
  - Turn off the heat. From 1 package Japanese curry roux, put 1-2 cubes in a ladleful of cooking liquid. Slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks and stir into the pot to incorporate. Repeat with the rest of the blocks, 2 cubes at a time. Tip - I use 1 full-sized box of store-bought curry roux, which is typically for 8-12 servings (be careful, as some brands offer a smaller box, which is 4 servings). With my homemade curry roux, I typically use 6-7 cubes for 8 servings (about 80% of the curry roux mixture if it hasn't solidified yet).
  - Simmer, uncovered, on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the curry becomes thick, about 5-10 minutes. If your curry is too thick, you can add water to thin the sauce. When you stir, make sure that no roux or food is stuck to the bottom of the pot; otherwise, it may burn.
