cuisine: indian
ingredients:
  - 3 tbsp vegetable or canola oil, or other neutral oil
  - 18g ginger, finely minced or as paste
  - 15g garlic, finely minced or as paste
  - 1 large onion, finely diced
  - 500g beef mince (ground beef)
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 tbsp kashmiri chilli
  - 1 heaped tsp garam masala
  - 1 heaped tsp cumin powder
  - 1 heaped tsp coriander powder
  - 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
  - 1 cup water
  # Garnish
  - 1 green chilli (optional)
  - coriander leaves (optional)
instructions:
  - Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add onion and cook for 1 minute until it is starting to turn translucent. Add ginger and garlic and saute for 30 seconds until golden, don't let it burn!
  - Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until it changes from pink to light brown. Add remaining ingredients EXCEPT water. Cook for a further 2 minutes to let the spices bloom.
  - Add water, stir, then put a loose lid on and cook for 10 minutes. Turn heat down to medium and let it simmer for 10 minutes or until most of the water has evaporated.
  - Serve over with basmati rice or plain white rice, garnish if desired.
notes:
  - Most often now i make a double batch of this recipe at once, and also add 1 can of chickpeas and 1 can of blackbeans for some feg/fibre. I will sometimes add a bit more spices and salt to compensate for the extra vegetable mass.
  - I often do a 50/50 beef/pork mix. Literally any mince will work here.
