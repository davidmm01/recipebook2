ingredients:
  - 1kg chicken breast, cubed
  - 500g mushrooms, sliced
  - 280g fresh spinach leaves
  - 1 340ml carnation creamy evaporated milk
  - 500g pasta, farfalline, farfalle, penne etc

  - 2 onions
  - 5 garlic cloves
  - 1 teaspoon dried thyme
  - 2 teaspoons paprika
  - 1L chicken broth
  - salt
  - pepper
  - 50g grated parmesan
instructions:
  - Heat 2tbsp olive oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add chicken, salt and pepper. Cook through and set aside.
  - Add 1tbsp olive oil and the onion into the pot and stir. Cook down for 1-2 minutes.
  - Add mushrooms and garlic, and stir to incorporate with the onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste as well as thyme and paprika. Stir to evenly season.
  - Add chicken broth and evaporated milk to the pot and stir. Bring to a boil, then add the pasta.
  - Cook according to package instructions, being sure to stir every 1-2 minutes to keep the pasta from clumping together. (Cook time may be a little longer in this recipe than when the pasta is boiled in water.)
  - When the farfalle pasta is al dente, add the spinach and chicken and stir until the spinach cooks down and incorporates.
  - Add parmesan and stir until it's well-incorporated and you're left with a smooth sauce.
  - Top off with extra parmesan and serve.
