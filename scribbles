Hey Claude, here I am building a simple website to view/create/update our recipes for foods, cocktails, and maybe other things in
the future.

The idea is as follows.

My website will have the following stack:
- frontend vibe coded in react
- go rest api on cloudrun

As for infra, it'll all be on google cloud
- recipes will be stored as objects in Firestore
- servers will run on cloudrun

What do you think of the stack?
My goal is to run this cheaply, or as little as is practical while still following sane practises and keeping it all gcp for ease.
